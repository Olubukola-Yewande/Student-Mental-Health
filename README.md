<h3>Tool Used</h3>
For this project, I leveraged on a powerful tool in data analytics to guide my analysis: <br>

Powerquery: I used powerquery for data transformation, cleaning and manipulation. <br>
PowerBi: I used this tool for data visualization. This tool makes it easy to cretae clear, informative, and visually compelling representation of data. <br>


<h3>The Analysis</h3>
1. What is the total number of students? <br>
This is an important KPI in this analysis and in getting the total number of students, I did a count of marital status column. This is because the dataset did not have a unique column. I believe that by counting the marital status column, I will get the total number of students which I did.
2. The count of depression by marital status. <br>
This analysis shows the counts of student experiencing depression, grouped by their marital status. In getting the count of depression by marital status, I did a count of depression by marital status. I put marital status on the X axis and depression count on the Y asxis.
